    <p><b>In a quiet old village, two young artists, Sue and Johnsy, lived together in a little apartment. One winter, Johnsy fell seriously ill with pneumonia. Lying in bed, she watched the ivy vine outside her window slowly lose its leaves to the cold wind.

She grew weaker and began to believe she would die when the last leaf fell. No matter how Sue tried to encourage her, Johnsy had given up hope.

In the same building lived an old painter named Behrman. He had never painted his masterpiece. When he heard about Johnsy's belief, he quietly went out during the stormy night and painted a perfect leaf on the wall where the real ivy had lost all of its own.

The next morning, Johnsy saw that one last leaf still clung to the vine. It gave her hope. She recovered.

But Behrman, who had been out in the cold to paint it, caught pneumonia and died. The painted leaf—his final and greatest work—saved Johnsy’s life.<b>
